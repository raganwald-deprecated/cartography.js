Cartography
===

Cartography is a simple Javascript library for writing object mapping functions using hashes. Cartography has been extracted from work produced by [Unspace Interactive][u]. All of the good bits, and its very existance, are due to Unspace. All of its bad bits are entirely the fault of [Reg Braithwaite][r].

**dependencies**

Cartography has a hard dependency on [Underscore][_].
